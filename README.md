"# GAN---Generative-Adversarial-Networks" 
**basic_gan_model.ipynb:**
Implemented a basic GAN model for generating images in the dataset the link to which is given below. The
input noise is approximated by a suitable distribution.

**build_latent_representation.ipynb:**
Found a good latent representation of length 100 using an autoencoder for the given dataset
of images. Also wrote the latent vector in a csv file(output.csv) with corresponding class label.

**gan_with_autoencoder.ipynb:**
Implemented another GAN to reproduce images of the same dataset, where the previous
autoencoder is used as generator.
